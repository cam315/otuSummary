Description: Summarizes the taxonomic composition, diversity contribution of the rare and abundant community by using OTU (operational taxonomic unit) table which was generated by analyzing pipeline of 'QIIME' or 'mothur'. The rare biosphere in this package is subset by the relative abundance threshold (for details about rare biosphere please see Lynch and Neufeld (2015) <doi:10.1038/nrmicro3400>).
